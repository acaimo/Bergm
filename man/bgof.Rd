\usage{
bgof(x, directed = FALSE, sample.size = 100, aux.iters = 10000,
  n.deg = NULL, n.dist = NULL, n.esp = NULL, n.ideg = NULL,
  n.odeg = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an \code{R} object of class \code{bergm}.}

\item{directed}{logical; TRUE if the observed graph is directed.}

\item{sample.size}{count; number of networks 
to be simulated and compared to the observed network.}

\item{aux.iters}{count; number of iterations used for network simulation.}

\item{n.deg}{count; used to plot only the first 
\code{n.deg}-1 degree distributions. 
By default no restrictions on the number of degree 
distributions is applied.}

\item{n.dist}{count; used to plot only the first 
\code{n.dist}-1 geodesic distances distributions. 
By default no restrictions on the number of geodesic 
distances distributions is applied.}

\item{n.esp}{count; used to plot only the first 
\code{n.esp}-1 edge-wise shared partner distributions. 
By default no restrictions on the number of 
edge-wise shared partner distributions is applied.}

\item{n.ideg}{count; used to plot only the first 
\code{n.ideg}-1 in-degree distributions. 
By default no restrictions on the number of 
in-degree distributions is applied.}

\item{n.odeg}{count; used to plot only the first 
\code{n.odeg}-1 out-degree distributions. 
By default no restrictions on the number of 
out-degree distributions is applied.}

\item{...}{additional arguments, 
to be passed to lower-level functions.}

\description{
Function to calculate summaries for degree, 
minimum geodesic distances, 
and edge-wise shared partner distributions 
to diagnose the Bayesian goodness-of-fit of 
exponential random graph models.
